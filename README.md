# Predict_CGPA
Predict_CGPA
This project predicts the first-semester CGPA of international master's students to identify at-risk students early and provide timely academic support. Using machine learning models, the goal is to improve student success and optimize institutional processes.

Overview
We applied several machine learning models to predict first-semester CGPA using a dataset of students enrolled at an international university between August 2018 and August 2023. The models used include:

Linear Regression

Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

K-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Benefits:
For Universities: Helps with resource allocation and student retention.

Early Intervention: Identifies at-risk students for timely support.

Institutional Improvement: Supports data-driven decision-making.

Web Platform
The prediction model is deployed on a custom web platform with an interactive interface, enabling real-time predictions and actionable insights.

How to Use
Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt.

Start the Web App: Launch the application and enter student data to predict CGPA.

Conclusion
This project aims to improve academic outcomes for international students using data-driven predictions and timely interventions.
